# Carbon-Footprint-Analysis-in-IT-Datacentres
This incorporates exploratory data analysis using Datacentre carbon emission datasets from Kaggle
# ▶️ Project Overview
This solution empowers business analysts, data scientists, and IT sustainability leaders to analyze, visualize, and report on carbon emissions from IT datacenters globally. Using the Databricks lakehouse architecture, it delivers an end-to-end EDA workflow across regional datasets—enabling actionable insights for sustainability goals and operational excellence. Cleaned, transformed, and aggregated emission data are profiled and visualized by country to facilitate benchmarking and strategy development.

# 📊 Key Features
